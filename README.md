# Cloud Computing
> Delivery model for services like:
* Storage -- files and Databases
* Compute Power -- windows and linux, web
* Networking
* Analytics -- Performance Data , Telemetry
* and more services
* over the internet
> Cloud Key Characteristics:
* Scalability
  * vertical scaling (Cpu memory size or storage)
    * scaling up
    * scalling down
  * Horizonal scaling
    * incresing amount of resources scaling out
    * decresing amount of resources scaling in
  * scalability is the ability to scale
  * scaling is a process of
      * allocating (adding)
      * deallocating(removing) resources
 * Elasticity:
    * Auto Scaling
    * Elasricity is the abilty to scale dynamically
  * Agility:
     * agility is the ability to react quickly
     * Agility is the ability to allocate and deallocate scale resources quickly
   * Fault Tolerance:
      * (web, vm, sql servers, disak arrays)
      * Fault tolerance is the ability to remain up and running during compoenet and service failure
      * Disaster is a serious disruption of services casued by natural or human induced causes
   * disaster recovery:
      * set up two data service with two regions)
      * Disaster ecovery is the ability to recover from an event that has taken down the service(disaster)
   * High Availability:
      * availabilty = uptime/ uptime + downtime
      * availabilty is a measure of  system uptime for users/services
      * High availabilty is the ability to keep service running for extended periods of time with very little downtime.
